            <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">How Crowdfunding Gave Me a Second Chance at Education – A Story from Chittagong</h1>
            <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">Name:Kalia Hossain<br/>Age: 22<br/>Location: Chittagong, Bangladesh<br/>Field of Study: Bachelor of Computer Science and Engineering<br/>University: University of Science and Technology Chittagong (USTC)</p>
            <p className="mb-4">My name is Kalia Hossain. I come from a humble family in the Halishahar area of Chittagong. Growing up, I always dreamt of becoming a software engineer. My fascination with computers began when I was in Class 6, and I would spend hours at a local cyber café exploring the internet. I loved solving problems and tinkering with computers, and soon I knew that my path lay in technology. But pursuing a higher education in Computer Science is expensive—something I could barely afford.</p>

            <p className="mb-4">This is my story of how crowdfunding not only saved my dream but transformed my life. I never thought strangers would care, but thanks to the kindness of people I’ve never met, I’m now in my final year of university and looking forward to building software that serves real-world needs.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">My Background</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li><strong>Family Situation:</strong> I come from a lower-middle-class family. My father is a small grocery shop owner, earning around 12,000–15,000 BDT per month, and my mother is a homemaker. We are a family of five—my parents, two younger siblings, and me.</li>
                <li><strong>Academic Journey:</strong> I studied at a government high school in Chittagong. I always scored well in school and stood among the top three in my class. I secured a GPA of 5.00 in both SSC and HSC examinations. My teachers encouraged me to pursue engineering, and I was lucky enough to get admitted into USTC’s Computer Science program.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Challenges I Faced</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">As excited as I was to get into USTC, I quickly realized the financial burden it would place on my family. The tuition fees, books, laptop costs, transportation, and living expenses were far more than we could afford. My father tried to manage by taking loans from relatives and reducing household expenses, but by the end of my first year, we were already drowning in debt.</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>Tuition Fees: Around 80,000 BDT per semester</li>
                <li>Laptop Requirement: Needed for coding and projects – cost approx. 45,000 BDT</li>
                <li>Books & Study Materials: ~10,000 BDT annually</li>
                <li>Internet Costs for Online Learning (During COVID): ~1,000 BDT/month</li>
                <li>Living Expenses (Food, Travel): ~4,000 BDT/month</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Discovering Crowdfunding</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">I had heard the term “crowdfunding” before, mostly in tech or startup news. But I didn&quot;t know it could work for personal needs like education. After some research, I discovered a few local and international crowdfunding platforms that allowed Bangladeshi students to raise funds for tuition and education-related expenses.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">What I Did</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>Chose a Platform</li>
                <li>Created My Campaign Page</li>
                <li>Made a Video</li>
                <li>Shared on Social Media</li>
                <li>Regular Updates</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">The Response I Received</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">To my surprise, the response was incredible. People from all over Bangladesh—and even a few Bangladeshis living abroad—started donating. Within 35 days, I had raised 1,40,000 BDT—enough to pay off my semester tuition, buy a second-hand laptop, and manage my basic living expenses for three months.</p>

            <p className="mb-4">As of 2025, I am in my final year at USTC. I completed an internship, started applying for jobs, and plan to start my own software development firm to help small businesses.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">My Advice to Other Students</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">

            <p className="mb-4">Crowdfunding changed my life. It took me from the edge of dropping out to the path of graduation. It connected me with kind, generous people I never knew existed. To anyone reading this—whether you&apos;re a student in need or someone wondering if your small donation will matter—I say this: Yes, it matters. Yes, people care. And yes, your story deserves to be heard.</p>
